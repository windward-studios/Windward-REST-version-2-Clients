# Swagger

- Windward provides non-Swagger fine tuned clients for .Net Standard 2.0 (runs on .Net Core and .Net Framework) and Java 8.
- For all other clients use Swagger from the openapi.yaml file here.
- This is also available at [Swagger Hub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Windward-Studios/windward-rest_ful_api/2.0)
